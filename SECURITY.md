# Security Policy

Security is a launch-critical priority for PrivChain.

## Report a Vulnerability

Do not report vulnerabilities in public issues.

Use private disclosure:

- Email: `hello@privchain.io`
- Subject: `PrivChain Security Report - <short title>`

Please include:

1. Affected component(s)
2. Reproduction steps or proof of concept
3. Impact assessment
4. Suggested mitigation (if available)
5. Contact details for follow-up

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgment: within 24 hours
- Triage decision: within 72 hours
- Remediation timeline: based on severity and exploitability

## Disclosure Model

PrivChain follows coordinated disclosure. Public disclosure occurs after remediation or compensating controls are in place.

## Scope Note

At the current pre-release stage, some implementation details are intentionally non-public to reduce attack-surface exposure.
