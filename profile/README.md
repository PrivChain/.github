# PrivChain

Privacy infrastructure for x402-compatible agent payments.

## Current Stage

PrivChain is in **private testnet hardening** with controlled partner preview access.

- Integration surface is built: facilitator lifecycle, settlement lookup, reconciliation, and signer interface boundaries.
- Developer surfaces are available for review: API, SDK direction, MCP tooling direction, and security summary.
- Launch-critical internals remain private until hardening and audit gates are closed.
- Rollout strategy is progressive: hardening -> external review -> broader partner onboarding.
